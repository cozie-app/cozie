## Introduction

This feature allows you to generate your cozie in a more convenient way. If you chose to generate the JSON file only, you can easily follow the steps detailed [here](json-file.md#build-and-install-cozie).

## Generate cozie

Once you created all your questions, you can easily click on the <strong>Get cozie with this question flow</strong> button. Then, you will be able to download a zip-file gathering all the file needed to build cozie with your question flow. Eventually, you can follow these steps:

- Extract the zip file.
- Open a Node.js terminal in the folder freshly extracted.
- Install npm:
```
npm install
```
(You don't need to worry about errors generated by this command)

- Log in into your Fitbit account. Then, build and install cozie on your Fitbit OS Simulator:
```
npx fitbit
fitbit$ build-and-install
```

Then, your cozie has been successfully built with your own question flow.
