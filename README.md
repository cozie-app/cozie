# Project Cozie  - A smartwatch methodology for quick and easy experience surveys 

## What is Cozie?

[Cozie](https://cozie-fitbit.app/) is a Fitit Ionic, Versa, Versa Lite and Versa 2 clock face that can ask people questions. It is useful for [experience sampling research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method) and was designed for the built environment, although there are also forks focused on [Covid-19 symptoms tracking](https://github.com/pjayathissa/cozie-covid)

The foundation for this project is the [BUDS Lab](https://www.budslab.org/) efforts towards human sujective feedback in the built environment:
