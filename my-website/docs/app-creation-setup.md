The Cozie basic app may not work for you for several reasons:
- You can't have your data flowing into the BUDS lab servers
- You'd like to create your own questions
- You'd like to contribute to the core repository!

In these cases, you can fork or branch the repository and use this tutorial to use the source code to create your own.

You can also reach out to [Clayton](mailto:clayton@nus.edu.sg) or [PJ](mailto:p.jayathissa@gmail.com) for consulting support.
